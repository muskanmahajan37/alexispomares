Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🧠 I’m currently working on Lymbeat, where we want to develop a whole new paradigm of brain-responsive applications
- 🔬 I’m currently researching on Deep Learning-based EEG classification into levels of consciousness
- 🌎 I’m actively looking for researchers and students to join our NeuroTechX London Student Clubs
