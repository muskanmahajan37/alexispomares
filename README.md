- ⚗️ I’m currently researching on [Deep Learning-based EEG analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K5gXXykUc5BsmHU2ICE4rd-anLHu0-G3/view) to objectively classify levels of consciousness
- ✨ I’m actively looking for researchers and students to join our [NeuroTechX London](https://neurotechx.com/chapter/1523/) Student Club
